# MUIT

This project was offered to me by the IT Administration office at Marshall University. The problem here was that Marshall's available software page through the IT website did not contain comprehensive information about University provided (or suggested) software packages. This page was also a static web page which linked to many other static pages related to University software and became cumbersome to maintain.

My solution to the problem was to create a custom php Wordpress plugin to incorporate into Marshall's Wordpress environment. This way, software packages can be updated site wide by pulling dynamically from a custom created database.
